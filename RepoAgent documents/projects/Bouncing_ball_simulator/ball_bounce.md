## ClassDef ball
**ball**: The function of ball is to simulate the movement of a bouncing ball on the screen.

**attributes**:
- ball_image: Stores the image of the ball.
- g: Represents the gravitational acceleration.
- velocityX: Stores the velocity of the ball in the horizontal direction.
- velocityY: Stores the velocity of the ball in the vertical direction.
- X: Stores the current x-coordinate of the ball.
- Y: Stores the current y-coordinate of the ball.

**Code Description**:
The `ball` class represents a bouncing ball in a simulation. It initializes the ball with a random position on the screen and sets initial velocities in both x and y directions. The `render_ball` method is responsible for displaying the ball on the screen using the loaded image. The `move_ball` method updates the position of the ball based on its velocity and handles collisions with the walls to simulate bouncing behavior. The vertical velocity is affected by gravity, and the ball reverses its direction when hitting the top or bottom walls.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `ball.png` image is available in the working directory for the ball to be displayed correctly.
- Adjust the screen dimensions (768x568) if needed to match the display area for the ball simulation.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of the ball object with default values.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as self is implicitly passed to refer to the instance itself.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the attributes of the ball object are initialized as follows:
- The velocity in the X direction is set to 4.
- The velocity in the Y direction is set to 4.
- The X coordinate is set to a random integer between 0 and 768.
- The Y coordinate is set to a random integer between 0 and 350.

**Note**:
- This function is called automatically when a new instance of the ball object is created.
- The random module needs to be imported to use the random.randint() function.

### FunctionDef render_ball(self)
**render_ball**: The function of render_ball is to display the ball on the screen at the specified coordinates.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- screen: The surface where the ball will be displayed.
- ball_image: The image of the ball to be rendered.
- X: The x-coordinate of the ball's position.
- Y: The y-coordinate of the ball's position.

**Code Description**:
The render_ball function takes the instance of the class, screen, ball_image, X, and Y as parameters. It uses the blit method to draw the ball_image on the screen at the specified coordinates (X, Y).

**Note**:
Make sure to pass the correct parameters to the render_ball function to display the ball accurately on the screen.
***
### FunctionDef move_ball(self)
**move_ball**: The function of move_ball is to update the position of the ball based on its current velocity and handle collisions with the walls.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed to this function explicitly, but it operates on the attributes of the object itself.

**Code Description**:
The move_ball function first updates the vertical component of the ball's velocity by adding the acceleration due to gravity (ball.g). Then, it adjusts the position of the ball by adding the current velocity components to the respective coordinates (X and Y). 

Next, the function checks for collisions with the walls. If the ball goes beyond the left or right boundaries (X<0 or X>768), the horizontal velocity is reversed by multiplying it by -1. If the ball hits the top wall (Y<0) while moving upwards (velocityY<0), the vertical velocity is reversed, and the ball's Y-coordinate is set to 0. Similarly, if the ball hits the bottom wall (Y>568) while moving downwards (velocityY>0), the vertical velocity is reversed, and the ball's Y-coordinate is set to 568.

**Note**:
- This function assumes a specific screen size (768x568) for handling wall collisions. Adjustments may be needed for different screen dimensions.
- The function does not handle collisions with other objects; additional logic would be required for such interactions.
