## FunctionDef start_fun
**start_fun**: The function of start_fun is to destroy the window1.

**parameters**: 
- This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The start_fun function is responsible for destroying the window1 object. This action effectively closes or removes the window1 from the user interface.

**Note**: 
- It is important to ensure that the window1 object exists and is accessible before calling this function to avoid any potential errors.
## FunctionDef exit_win
**exit_win**: The function of exit_win is to prompt the user with a confirmation dialog asking if they want to exit, and if confirmed, it destroys a specific window.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The exit_win function utilizes the `askokcancel` method of the `mbox` object to display a dialog box with the message "Do you want to exit?" and options to confirm or cancel the exit. If the user chooses to exit (by clicking 'OK'), the function proceeds to destroy the `window1` object.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to handle the exit action in a graphical user interface (GUI) application, ensuring that the user confirms their intention before closing the window.
- Ensure that the `mbox` and `window1` objects are appropriately defined and accessible within the scope of this function for it to work as intended.
## FunctionDef convert_to_gbit(value)
**convert_to_gbit**: The function of convert_to_gbit is to convert a value representing data size in bytes to gigabits.

**parameters**:
- value: A numerical value representing data size in bytes.

**Code Description**:
The convert_to_gbit function takes a value in bytes and converts it to gigabits. It achieves this conversion by dividing the input value by 1024 three times to convert bytes to gigabytes, and then multiplying by 8 to convert gigabytes to gigabits.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the input value is in bytes for accurate conversion. The function assumes the input value is in bytes and performs the necessary calculations to convert it to gigabits.

**Output Example**:
If the input value is 1073741824 bytes, the function will return 8.0, which represents 8 gigabits.
## FunctionDef update_label
**update_label**: The function of update_label is to update the network usage label in the user interface, display the current network usage in bytes per second, show the connection status, and notify the user if the maximum limit of network usage is exceeded.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The update_label function first calculates the new network usage value by summing up the bytes sent and received using the psutil library. It then formats the difference between the new and old network usage values to three decimal places and updates the label in the user interface with the current network usage information.

Next, the function retrieves the IP address of the host machine and checks if it is the localhost (127.0.0.1). Depending on the result, it updates the connection status label accordingly.

If the difference between the new and old network usage values exceeds 1,000,000 bytes, a message box is displayed to inform the user that the maximum limit of network usage has been exceeded.

Finally, the old network usage value is updated with the new value, and the function waits for 0.5 seconds before calling itself again using the window.after method to continuously update the network usage label.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the psutil and socket libraries are imported before calling this function.
- Make sure to have the necessary GUI elements (l1, l2, path_text, mbox) defined in the user interface for the function to update the labels and display messages.
- Adjust the threshold value (1,000,000 bytes) for maximum network usage as needed for your application.
## FunctionDef exit_win
**exit_win**: The function of exit_win is to prompt the user with a confirmation dialog asking if they want to exit, and if confirmed, it will destroy the window.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The exit_win function utilizes the `askokcancel` method of the `mbox` object to display a dialog box with the message "Do you want to exit?" and options to confirm or cancel the exit. If the user chooses to exit by clicking "OK", the function then calls the `destroy` method on the `window` object, which closes the window.

**Note**: 
- This function is typically used as a callback for an exit button or menu item to provide a user-friendly way to confirm exiting the application.
