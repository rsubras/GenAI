## FunctionDef find_the_video(file_name, directory_name)
**find_the_video**: The function of find_the_video is to search for a specific file in a given directory and return its path.

**parameters**:
- file_name: The name of the file to be found.
- directory_name: The directory where the search for the file will be performed.

**Code Description**:
The function iterates through the directory specified by directory_name using os.walk to search for the file with the name provided in file_name. If the file is found, its full path is stored in files_found list. Finally, the function prints the list of found files and returns the path of the first file found.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the file_name and directory_name parameters are correctly provided to the function.
- The function returns the path of the first found file, so it assumes that there is only one file with the specified name in the directory.

## FunctionDef PlayVideo(video_path)
**PlayVideo**: The function of PlayVideo is to play a video file and its corresponding audio.

**parameters**:
- video_path: A string representing the file path of the video to be played.

**Code Description**:
The PlayVideo function utilizes the OpenCV library to read and display a video file. It creates a video object using cv2.VideoCapture() and a media player object using MediaPlayer(). The function then enters a loop where it reads frames from the video and audio frames from the media player. If the end of the video is reached or the user presses 'q', the loop breaks, releasing the video resources and closing the video window.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide the correct file path to the video file when calling the PlayVideo function.
- Press 'q' to exit the video playback window.
