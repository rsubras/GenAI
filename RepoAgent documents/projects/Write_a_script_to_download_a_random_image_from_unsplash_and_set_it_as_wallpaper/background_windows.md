## FunctionDef is_64bit
**is_64bit**: The function of is_64bit is to determine if the system is running on a 64-bit architecture.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The is_64bit function checks if the system is running on a 64-bit architecture by comparing the maximum size of an integer (sys.maxsize) with 2 raised to the power of 32. If the maximum size is greater than 2 to the power of 32, it indicates a 64-bit system.

In the project, this function is called within the setup function in background_windows.py to determine the system architecture before setting the desktop wallpaper. Depending on the result of is_64bit, the appropriate SystemParametersInfo function is called to set the wallpaper.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary libraries (sys, os, ctypes) are imported before calling this function.
- This function relies on the sys module to determine the system's maximum integer size.

**Output Example**:
True
## FunctionDef download(url, file_name)
**download**: The function of download is to download a file from a specified URL and save it with a given file name.

**parameters**:
- url: The URL from which the file will be downloaded.
- file_name: The name under which the downloaded file will be saved.

**Code Description**:
The download function utilizes the 'open' function to create a file with the specified file name in binary write mode ("wb"). It then sends a GET request to the provided URL using the 'get' function and writes the content of the response to the created file.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the URL provided is accessible and points to a valid file that can be downloaded. Additionally, the file name should be a valid and writable path on the system where the script is being executed.
## FunctionDef setup(pathtofile, version)
**setup**: The function of setup is to set the desktop wallpaper on a Windows system using the provided image file path.

**parameters**:
- pathtofile: The path to the image file that will be set as the desktop wallpaper.
- version: The version of the wallpaper setting function to use.

**Code Description**:
The setup function first constructs the full path to the image file by joining the current working directory with the provided file path. It then determines the system architecture by calling the is_64bit function. Depending on the system architecture, either the SystemParametersInfoW or SystemParametersInfoA function is invoked to set the desktop wallpaper using the specified image file.

The setup function is an essential part of the script designed to download a random image from Unsplash and set it as the wallpaper on a Windows system. It ensures that the wallpaper setting process is compatible with the system's architecture, allowing for seamless wallpaper updates.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary libraries (os, ctypes) are imported before calling this function.
- The setup function relies on the is_64bit function to determine the appropriate SystemParametersInfo function to use for setting the desktop wallpaper.
