## FunctionDef verify
**verify**: The function of verify is to check if the user-entered number matches the randomly generated captcha number and display a success message or an alert accordingly. 

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The verify function retrieves the user-entered number from the input field. It then compares this number with the randomly generated captcha number. If the numbers match, a success message "verified" is displayed using the messagebox.showinfo function. Otherwise, an alert message "Not verified" is shown. Additionally, if the numbers do not match, the refresh function is called to generate a new captcha image for verification.

In the project, the verify function interacts with the refresh function to ensure that users can verify the captcha successfully by comparing the entered number with the randomly generated one.

**Note**:
- The verify function does not accept any parameters and is responsible for validating user input against the captcha number.
## FunctionDef refresh
**refresh**: The function of refresh is to generate a new captcha image and update the display with the new image.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The refresh function starts by generating a random 6-digit number as a string. It then uses this random number to create a new captcha image. The function asserts that the data generated is an instance of BytesIO. The captcha image is saved as 'out.png'. Next, the function creates a PhotoImage object using the saved image file. It updates the display label 'l1' with the new image, setting the height to 100 and width to 200. Finally, the function calls the UpdateLabel function to update the label with the new captcha image.

In the project, the refresh function is called by the verify function. When the user enters a number in the input field and clicks verify, the verify function checks if the entered number matches the randomly generated captcha number. If the numbers match, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an alert is shown, and the refresh function is called to generate a new captcha image for verification.

**Note**:
- The refresh function does not take any parameters and generates a new captcha image each time it is called.
