## ClassDef SampleApp
**SampleApp**: The function of SampleApp is to create a Tkinter application with the ability to switch between different frames.

**attributes**: 
· self._frame: Represents the current frame being displayed in the application.

**Code Description**: 
The SampleApp class is a subclass of the Tkinter Tk class. It initializes the application by setting up the main window and then switches between different frames within the application. The switch_frame method is responsible for creating a new frame based on the input frame_class and displaying it while destroying the previous frame if it exists.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the SampleApp class as a foundation for creating multi-frame Tkinter applications. When using this class, ensure that the frames being switched between are properly implemented and handle any necessary cleanup operations when destroying frames.

### FunctionDef switch_frame(self, frame_class)
**switch_frame**: The function of switch_frame is to switch the current frame to a new frame specified by the frame_class parameter.

**parameters**:
· frame_class: The class of the frame to switch to.

**Code Description**:
The switch_frame function creates a new instance of the specified frame_class, destroys the current frame if it exists, assigns the new frame to the _frame attribute, and then packs the new frame.

In the calling situation, the switch_frame function is called in the __init__ method of the SampleApp class. When the SampleApp object is initialized, the switch_frame function is used to switch the frame to the StartPage class.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the frame_class parameter is a valid class that can be instantiated.
- Make sure that the frame switching logic aligns with the desired flow of the application.

### FunctionDef checkBtn_click(self, master, user_text, check_answer, canv, check_img)
**checkBtn_click**: The function of checkBtn_click is to handle the user input validation, display corresponding images on the canvas based on the correctness of the input, and manage the flow of the game by updating the score and transitioning to the finish page when the game is completed.

**parameters**:
- master: Represents the main widget.
- user_text: The user input text to be validated.
- check_answer: The correct answer to compare with the user input.
- canv: The canvas object for displaying images.
- check_img: The image to be displayed for checking.

**Code Description**:
The `checkBtn_click` function first converts the user input and correct answer to uppercase and removes spaces for accurate comparison. It then checks if the user input matches the correct answer. If the input is correct, a 'correct' image is displayed on the canvas, the correct count is incremented, and if all problems are resolved, the game transitions to the FinishPage. If the input is incorrect, a 'wrong' image is displayed. After a delay, the result image is removed using the `delete_img` function. A random image is selected for the next question, ensuring it exists in the dataset. The selected image is displayed on the canvas along with the corresponding country name.

**Note**:
- Ensure the `dele_img_name` parameter in the `delete_img` function matches the name of the image to be deleted.
- Utilize this function to manage user input validation, image display, and game progression effectively.
- Handle exceptions related to image loading and user input validation for a seamless gaming experience.

### FunctionDef passBtn_click(self, tk, canv, check_img)
**passBtn_click**: The function of passBtn_click is to handle the event when the pass button is clicked in the CountryPage of the Speed Game application.

**parameters**:
- tk: Represents the tkinter module for GUI.
- canv: Represents the canvas object where images are displayed.
- check_img: Specifies the image to be checked.

**Code Description**:
The `passBtn_click` function decrements the pass count, checks if the count is valid, randomly selects an image, handles exceptions for images not in the dataset, displays the image on the canvas, and updates the answer. It then removes the pass window element, creates a new pass button, and places it on the canvas.

This function interacts with the `delete_img` function to remove the pass window element from the canvas. Additionally, it utilizes global variables for pass count, answer, country image, and pass window.

**Note**:
- Ensure the correct handling of pass count to prevent negative values.
- Utilize this function to manage the pass button functionality within the CountryPage of the Speed Game application effectively.

### FunctionDef delete_img(self, canv, dele_img_name)
**delete_img**: The function of delete_img is to remove a specified image from the canvas.

**parameters**:
- canv: Represents the canvas from which the image needs to be deleted.
- dele_img_name: Specifies the name of the image to be deleted from the canvas.

**Code Description**:
The `delete_img` function takes two parameters: `canv` representing the canvas object and `dele_img_name` which is the name of the image to be deleted. Within the function, it calls the `delete` method on the canvas object `canv` with the `dele_img_name` parameter to remove the specified image from the canvas.

In the calling objects within the project:
- In the `checkBtn_click` function of the `CountryPage` class, after displaying a result image on the canvas, the `delete_img` function is called to remove the result image after a delay. Additionally, it is called to delete the `check_img` after a delay as well.
- In the `passBtn_click` function of the `CountryPage` class, the `delete_img` function is called to remove the `pass_window` element from the canvas.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `dele_img_name` parameter matches the name of the image that needs to be deleted from the canvas.
- Use this function to efficiently manage and update images displayed on the canvas by removing specific images when needed.
***
## ClassDef FinishPage
**FinishPage**: The function of FinishPage is to display the final page of the game with the total score and a congratulatory message.

**attributes**:
- parameter1: master (represents the parent widget)
- ImagePath: Path to the background image used on the page
- canv: Canvas widget for drawing graphics
- img: PhotoImage object for displaying the background image
- labelFont: Font settings for text display

**Code Description**:
The `FinishPage` class initializes a frame with a background image, total score text, and a congratulatory message. The background image is loaded from the specified path using `Image.open` and displayed on a canvas widget. Text displaying the total score and a congratulatory message are added to the canvas using the specified font settings.

In the calling situation within the project, the `FinishPage` class is invoked when the player completes all the game tasks. The `FinishPage` is displayed to show the final score and congratulate the player on completing the game.

**Note**:
- Ensure the 'halloween.png' image exists in the specified path for proper display.
- The total score and congratulatory messages are displayed at the center of the canvas.
- Make sure to handle any exceptions related to image loading or font settings to prevent errors during execution.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, master)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the FinishPage object with the specified parameters.

**parameters**:
- master: The parent widget to which the FinishPage object belongs.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the FinishPage object is initialized by setting up a canvas with a white background and loading an image from the 'halloween.png' file. The total score and a congratulatory message are displayed on the canvas using text elements. The font style for the text is defined with a family of "Arial", size of 40, and bold weight.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the 'halloween.png' image file exists in the specified path for the image loading to be successful.
- The correct_count variable used in the text display should be defined and updated appropriately before calling this function.
