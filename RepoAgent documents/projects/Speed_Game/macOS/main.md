## ClassDef SampleApp
**SampleApp**: The function of SampleApp is to create an application window and manage the switching of frames within the application.

**attributes**:
- _frame: Represents the current frame displayed in the application.

**Code Description**:
The SampleApp class is a subclass of tk.Tk, which is used to create the main application window. The constructor (__init__) initializes the application by calling the constructor of the tk.Tk class. It also initializes the _frame attribute to None and calls the switch_frame method with the StartPage class as an argument to set the initial frame of the application.

The switch_frame method is responsible for switching between different frames within the application. It takes a frame_class as a parameter, creates a new instance of the specified frame_class, destroys the current frame if it exists, assigns the new frame to the _frame attribute, and displays the new frame using the pack method.

**Note**:
- Make sure to define the StartPage class or any other frame classes before using them with the switch_frame method.
- Ensure that the frames being switched are properly designed and implemented to avoid any errors during the switching process.

### FunctionDef switch_frame(self, frame_class)
**switch_frame**: The function of switch_frame is to switch the current frame of the application to a new frame specified by the frame_class parameter.

**parameters**:
- frame_class: The class of the frame to switch to.

**Code Description**:
The switch_frame function creates a new instance of the specified frame_class, destroys the current frame if it exists, assigns the new frame to the _frame attribute, and then packs the new frame to display it.

In the calling object projects\Speed_Game\macOS\main.py/SampleApp/__init__, the switch_frame function is called within the __init__ method. It initializes the application by setting the _frame attribute to None and then immediately switches to the StartPage frame by calling switch_frame with the StartPage class.

**Note**:
- Make sure to pass the correct frame_class parameter to switch_frame to switch to the desired frame.
- Ensure that the frame_class parameter is a valid class that can be instantiated to create a new frame.

## ClassDef StartPage
**StartPage**: The function of StartPage is to display the initial page of the Speed Game application with a start button to begin the game.

**attributes**:
- ImagePath: A string representing the path to the image file used for the background.
- canv: A canvas widget for displaying graphics.
- img: An ImageTk.PhotoImage object for the image displayed on the canvas.
- labelFont: A font object for styling the text on the canvas.
- startBtnFont: A font object for styling the start button text.

**Code Description**:
The StartPage class initializes the initial page of the Speed Game application. It creates a canvas with a background image, displays the game title, and provides a start button to begin the game. The background image, text, and button styles are set within the class. The start button triggers a function to switch the frame to the CategoryPage when clicked.

The StartPage class is called by the SampleApp class in the main.py file to set the initial frame of the application. When the application starts, the switch_frame method in SampleApp is used to switch to the StartPage.

The StartPage class is related to the CategoryPage class, which is another page in the application. The start button on the StartPage triggers a frame switch to the CategoryPage, allowing the user to navigate between different sections of the game.

**Note**: Ensure the ImagePath variable points to a valid image file in the correct location. Customize the text, font styles, and button appearance as needed for the application design.

### FunctionDef checkBtn_click(self, master, user_text, check_answer, canv, check_img)
**checkBtn_click**: The function of checkBtn_click is to handle the user input validation in a game scenario, checking if the user's answer matches the correct answer and displaying corresponding images on the canvas.

**parameters**:
- master: Represents the parent widget.
- user_text: The user's input text.
- check_answer: The correct answer to be checked against the user's input.
- canv: The canvas widget for displaying images.
- check_img: The image to be displayed for checking.

**Code Description**:
The `checkBtn_click` function processes the user's input by converting it to uppercase and removing spaces for comparison with the correct answer. If the user's input matches the correct answer, a 'correct' message is printed, and a 'correct.png' image is displayed on the canvas. If the answers do not match, a 'wrong' message is printed, and a 'wrong.png' image is displayed. The function also handles the logic to switch frames when the user has resolved all problems. Additionally, it selects a random image, validates its code, displays the image on the canvas, and assigns the corresponding answer.

This function calls the `delete_img` function to remove images from the canvas after a certain delay. It interacts with the `FinishPage` class to switch frames when all problems are solved.

**Note**:
- Ensure proper handling of user input validation and image display logic.
- Pay attention to the correct handling of canvas elements and image deletion.
- Utilize the function within the game flow to manage user interactions effectively.

### FunctionDef passBtn_click(self, tk, canv, check_img)
**passBtn_click**: The function of passBtn_click is to handle the logic when the user clicks on the pass button in the game, allowing them to skip a question.

**parameters**:
- tk: The tkinter module for GUI.
- canv: The canvas object where images are displayed.
- check_img: The image to be checked.

**Code Description**:
The `passBtn_click` function decrements the pass count, checks if the count is valid, selects a random image, displays it on the canvas, and updates the answer based on the image code. It then updates the pass button text, creates a new pass button, and places it on the canvas. Finally, it calls the `delete_img` function to remove the pass window.

This function interacts with the `delete_img` function to remove the pass window and manage image deletion on the canvas. It also relies on global variables for pass count, answer, country image, and pass window.

**Note**:
- Ensure the correct parameters are passed to the function to avoid errors.
- The function is crucial for managing the pass functionality in the game and updating the UI accordingly.
***
### FunctionDef delete_img(self, canv, dele_img_name)
**delete_img**: The function of delete_img is to delete a specified image from the canvas.

**parameters**:
- canv: The canvas from which the image needs to be deleted.
- dele_img_name: The name of the image to be deleted from the canvas.

**Code Description**:
The `delete_img` function takes two parameters: `canv` representing the canvas object and `dele_img_name` which is the name of the image to be deleted from the canvas. Within the function, it calls the `delete` method on the canvas object `canv` to remove the image specified by `dele_img_name`.

In the project, this function is called in two different scenarios:
1. In the `checkBtn_click` function:
   - After displaying a result image on the canvas, the `delete_img` function is called to remove the result image after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
   - It is also called to delete the `check_img` after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
   
2. In the `passBtn_click` function:
   - It is called to remove the `check_img` after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
   - Additionally, it is called to delete the `pass_window`.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `dele_img_name` provided matches the name of the image that needs to be deleted from the canvas.
- The function is designed to handle the deletion of images on the canvas, so make sure to pass the correct parameters to avoid any unintended deletions.
***
## ClassDef FinishPage
**FinishPage**: The function of FinishPage is to display the final page of the game with the total score and a congratulatory message.

**attributes**:
- parameter1: master (represents the parent widget)
- ImagePath: Path to the image file used for the background
- canv: Canvas widget for displaying graphics
- img: PhotoImage object for the background image
- labelFont: Font settings for text display

**Code Description**:
The `FinishPage` class initializes by setting up the background image, creating a Canvas widget, displaying the total score, and a congratulatory message in the center of the canvas. The background image is loaded from the specified path. Text displaying the total score and the congratulatory message is created using the specified font settings. 

The `FinishPage` class is called from the `checkBtn_click` method in the `CountryPage` class when the player has completed all the problems. It is also called from the `count` method in the `CountryPage` class when the timer reaches zero.

**Note**:
- Ensure the 'halloween.png' image file exists in the specified path for the background.
- The `correct_count` variable is used to keep track of the correct answers in the game.
- Make sure to handle the transition to the `FinishPage` appropriately based on the game logic.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, master)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the FinishPage object with the specified parameters.

**parameters**:
- master: The parent widget where the FinishPage object will be placed.

**Code Description**:
In this __init__ function, the FinishPage object is initialized with the given master widget. The function first sets the ImagePath variable to 'halloween.png'. Then, it creates a canvas (canv) with a width of 600, height of 500, and a white background color, which is packed at the bottom of the FinishPage. 

Next, it loads an image from the specified path, resizes it to 600x500 pixels using Image.ANTIALIAS, and assigns it to self.img as a PhotoImage. This image is then displayed on the canvas at coordinates (0, 0) with the anchor set to "nw".

Following that, the function defines a labelFont with specific attributes (family, size, weight) and creates two text elements on the canvas. The first text displays the total score along with the correct_count variable value out of 15, and the second text displays "Good Job!".

**Note**:
- Ensure that the 'halloween.png' image exists in the specified path for proper execution.
- The correct_count variable used in the text display should be defined and updated elsewhere in the code to reflect the actual score.
