## FunctionDef fetch(page_no, verbose)
**fetch**: The function of fetch is to retrieve and scrape data from the specified page number of Hacker News website.

**parameters**:
- page_no: An integer representing the page number to fetch data from.
- verbose: A boolean flag indicating whether to display verbose output (default is False).

**Code Description**:
The fetch function takes the page number as input and retrieves the corresponding page from the Hacker News website. It limits the page number to a maximum of 20. If the verbose flag is set to True, it prints a message indicating the page being fetched. The function then sends a GET request to the Hacker News website, parses the HTML content, extracts relevant information about each article (such as title, URL, author, score, etc.), and writes this information to a text file named 'NewsPageX.txt', where X is the page number.

In case of any connection errors, it handles exceptions and prints appropriate error messages. It also ensures that the necessary libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup) are imported at the beginning of the script.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries are installed before using this function.
- The function will raise a ValueError if the page number is less than or equal to 0.
- The function limits the page number to a maximum of 20 to prevent excessive requests to the website.
