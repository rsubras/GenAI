## FunctionDef parse_args(argv)
**parse_args**: The function of parse_args is to parse command-line arguments for a website summarization utility.

**parameters**:
- argv: A list of command-line arguments passed to the function.

**Code Description**:
The `parse_args` function utilizes the `argparse` module to create a command-line argument parser for a website summarization utility. It defines several arguments such as 'action', 'url', 'sentence', 'language', and 'path' with their respective descriptions and default values. The function then parses the arguments and returns the parsed values.

This function is called by the `main` function in the `app.py` file within the Web_page_summation project. In the `main` function, the parsed arguments are used to determine the action to be taken, such as summarizing a website or processing a CSV file based on the provided arguments.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `argparse` module is imported at the beginning of the script to use the `ArgumentParser` class.
- The function expects command-line arguments to be passed as a list.
- Make sure to handle the returned parsed arguments appropriately in the calling function.

**Output Example**:
An example of the return value after parsing the command-line arguments:
Namespace(action='summarize', url='https://example.com', sentence=3, language='English', path='data.csv')
## FunctionDef readCsv(path)
**readCsv**: The function of readCsv is to read a CSV file from the specified path and return its data as a list.

**parameters**:
- path: The file path of the CSV file to be read.

**Code Description**:
The readCsv function first attempts to open the CSV file at the provided path and read its contents using the csv.reader. If an exception occurs during the initial attempt, the function retries to open the file with a specific encoding ("mbcs"). It then reads each row of the CSV file and appends it to a list. Finally, the function returns the list of data read from the CSV file.

This function is called by the processCsv function in the app.py file of the Web_page_summation project. In the processCsv function, readCsv is used to read data from a CSV file before further processing and writing the data to another CSV file.

**Note**:
Ensure that the file path provided is correct and accessible.
Handle exceptions appropriately when reading the CSV file.

**Output Example**:
[['data1_row1', 'data1_row2', 'data1_row3'],
 ['data2_row1', 'data2_row2', 'data2_row3'],
 ['data3_row1', 'data3_row2', 'data3_row3']]
## FunctionDef writeCsv(data, LANGUAGE, SENTENCES_COUNT)
**writeCsv**: The function of writeCsv is to update a CSV file by adding a summary of web pages listed in the file.

**parameters**:
- data: The data containing web page information.
- LANGUAGE: The language used for summarization.
- SENTENCES_COUNT: The number of sentences to include in the summary.

**Code Description**:
The `writeCsv` function updates a CSV file named 'beneficiary.csv' by adding a summary of each web page listed in the input data. It iterates through the data, retrieves the website position, and appends a 'summary' column to the first row. For each subsequent row, it calls the `summarize` function to generate a summary based on the website content, language, and sentence count. The generated summary is then added to the respective row in the CSV file. Error handling is implemented to skip lines in case of any issues during the summarization process.

In the project structure, the `writeCsv` function is called within the `processCsv` function in the `app.py` file. The `processCsv` function reads data from a CSV file, and then invokes the `writeCsv` function to update the file with web page summaries.

**Note**:
- Ensure the input data contains the necessary website information.
- Handle exceptions appropriately to manage errors during the CSV file update process.
## FunctionDef processCsv(path, LANGUAGE, SENTENCES_COUNT)
**processCsv**: The function of processCsv is to read data from a CSV file, process it, and write the processed data to another CSV file.

**parameters**:
- path: The file path of the CSV file to be processed.
- LANGUAGE: The language used for summarization.
- SENTENCES_COUNT: The number of sentences to include in the summary.

**Code Description**:
The processCsv function initiates the processing of a CSV file by first attempting to read the data using the readCsv function. It then proceeds to write the processed data to a new CSV file using the writeCsv function. Exception handling is implemented to manage errors that may occur during the file processing. The function prints messages to indicate the start of the processing and notifies about any invalid file paths encountered during the process.

This function is called within the main function of the app.py file in the Web_page_summation project. In the main function, based on the specified action ('bulk' or 'simple'), processCsv is invoked to handle CSV file processing tasks. Upon completion of the processing, the function checks for the existence of the updated CSV file and moves it to the specified path if applicable.

**Note**:
- Ensure to provide a valid file path for processing.
- Handle exceptions appropriately to address any issues with file processing.
- Monitor the console output for processing updates and error notifications.
## FunctionDef main(argv)
**main**: The function of main is to handle different actions based on command-line arguments, such as summarizing a website or processing a CSV file.

**parameters**:
- argv: A list of command-line arguments passed to the function.

**Code Description**:
The `main` function configures logging settings and parses command-line arguments using the `parse_args` function. It then determines the action to be taken (bulk or simple) based on the provided arguments. If the action is 'bulk', it processes a CSV file by calling the `processCsv` function. In case of 'simple' action, it summarizes a web page using the `summarize` function. Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs and file paths. Upon completion, the function prints messages and, if applicable, moves the updated CSV file.

The `main` function interacts with other functions in the project, such as `parse_args`, `processCsv`, and `summarize`, to execute specific tasks based on the user's input.

**Note**:
- Ensure to provide valid inputs for the action, URL, and file path.
- Handle exceptions to address errors during file processing or web page summarization.
- Monitor the console output for progress updates and error notifications.

**Output Example**:
An example of the return value after executing the `main` function:
Completed
