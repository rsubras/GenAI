Then, it initializes a stemmer and a summarizer to generate the summary. Stop words specific to the chosen language are set for the summarizer. The function iterates through the sentences in the summarized content and appends them to the result. If an exception occurs during the process, an error message is printed, and an invalid entry message is returned. Finally, the function prints the URL and the generated summary before returning the result.

The summary is then appended to the respective row in the CSV file. Error handling is implemented to skip lines in case of any issues during the summarization process.

Handle exceptions appropriately to manage errors during the summarization process.
