## ClassDef Model
**Model**: The function of Model is to define a deep learning model for text summarization tasks.

**attributes**:
- reversed_dict: A dictionary containing reversed word indices.
- article_max_len: Maximum length of input articles.
- summary_max_len: Maximum length of output summaries.
- args: Arguments containing model hyperparameters.
- forward_only: A boolean indicating if the model is used for inference only.

**Code Description**:
The `Model` class initializes various attributes such as vocabulary size, embedding size, number of hidden layers, learning rate, beam width, and others based on the provided arguments. It sets up the neural network architecture for text summarization using TensorFlow, including embedding layers, encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanism, and loss calculation for training. The class handles both training and inference modes, adjusting the behavior accordingly. The model architecture follows best practices for sequence-to-sequence tasks like text summarization.

In the project structure, the `Model` class is located in the `model.py` file under the `utils` package of the `Web_page_summation` project. It is a crucial component for building and training the text summarization model. Other modules like `test.py` and `train.py` in the same `utils` package might utilize the `Model` class for testing and training the model, respectively. These modules interact with the `Model` class to perform specific tasks related to text summarization within the project.

**Note**: Developers can instantiate the `Model` class with the required parameters to create a text summarization model and utilize its methods for training or generating summaries based on the mode of operation.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, reversed_dict, article_max_len, summary_max_len, args, forward_only)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Model object with the provided parameters.

**parameters**:
· reversed_dict: A dictionary containing the reversed mapping of vocabulary.
· article_max_len: Maximum length of the input article.
· summary_max_len: Maximum length of the summary.
· args: Arguments object containing various configuration parameters.
· forward_only: A boolean flag indicating if the model is used for inference only.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the Model object with the given parameters. It sets up the neural network architecture for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:
- It calculates and assigns the vocabulary size, embedding size, number of hidden units, number of layers, learning rate, and beam width based on the provided arguments.
- It handles the dropout probability based on the forward_only flag.
- It sets up the projection layer for the decoder.
- It defines the input and output placeholders for the model.
- It initializes the embeddings for the encoder and decoder.
- It constructs the encoder using a bidirectional LSTM architecture.
- It configures the decoder with or without attention mechanism based on the forward_only flag.
- It computes the loss function for training the model and defines the optimization process using the Adam optimizer.

**Note**:
- The Model object is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as text summarization.
- The function supports both training and inference modes based on the forward_only parameter.
- Ensure that the input data shapes match the placeholders defined in the function for proper model execution.
