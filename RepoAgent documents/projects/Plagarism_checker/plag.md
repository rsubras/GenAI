## FunctionDef vectorize(Text)
**vectorize**: The function of vectorize is to transform the input text data into a numerical vector representation using the TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library.

**parameters**:
- Text: A list of text data that needs to be vectorized.

**Code Description**:
The vectorize function takes a list of text data as input. It then uses the TfidfVectorizer() function from the scikit-learn library to convert the text data into a numerical vector representation. The fit_transform() method is used to fit the vectorizer to the text data and transform it into a matrix of TF-IDF features. Finally, the toarray() method is applied to convert the sparse matrix into a dense NumPy array, which is returned as the output.

**Note**:
Make sure to have the scikit-learn library installed to use the TfidfVectorizer.
Ensure that the input text data is in a list format for proper vectorization.

**Output Example**:
[[0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0.]]
## FunctionDef similarity(doc1, doc2)
**similarity**: The function of similarity is to calculate the cosine similarity between two input documents.

**parameters**:
- doc1: The first document vector for comparison.
- doc2: The second document vector for comparison.

**Code Description**:
The similarity function takes two document vectors as input, calculates the cosine similarity between them using the cosine_similarity function, and returns the result.

In the project, the similarity function is called within the check_plagiarism function. Inside the check_plagiarism function, the similarity function is used to compare text vectors of different students to identify potential plagiarism cases. The similarity score between the text vectors of two students is calculated, and if the score indicates a high similarity, the student pair along with the similarity score is added to the plagiarism_results set.

**Note**:
- The similarity function relies on the cosine_similarity function to compute the similarity between document vectors.
- Ensure that the document vectors passed to the similarity function are appropriately preprocessed and formatted for accurate similarity calculations.

**Output Example**:
If the similarity function is called with document vectors [0.2, 0.4, 0.6] and [0.1, 0.3, 0.5], the output may be 0.98, indicating a high similarity between the two documents.
## FunctionDef check_plagiarism
The function of check_plagiarism is to compare text vectors of different students to identify potential plagiarism cases by calculating the similarity score between the text vectors of two students and adding the student pair along with the similarity score to the plagiarism_results set.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The check_plagiarism function iterates over the student vectors stored in s_vectors. For each pair of student vectors, it calculates the similarity score using the similarity function from the similarity object. If the similarity score indicates a high similarity between the text vectors of two students, the student pair along with the similarity score is added to the plagiarism_results set. The function then returns the plagiarism_results set.

Within the check_plagiarism function, the similarity function from the similarity object is utilized to compute the cosine similarity between document vectors. This comparison helps in identifying potential cases of plagiarism based on the similarity between the text content of different students.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the s_vectors variable containing student vectors is appropriately populated before calling the check_plagiarism function.
- The similarity function from the similarity object should be correctly implemented and accessible for accurate similarity calculations.

**Output Example**:
If the check_plagiarism function is executed with the provided student vectors, the output may include a set of student pairs along with their similarity scores indicating potential plagiarism cases.
