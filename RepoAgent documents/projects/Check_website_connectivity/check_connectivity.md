## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to check the status of websites listed in a file and save the results to a CSV file.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The main function reads a file named "websites.txt" which contains a list of website URLs. It then iterates through each URL, sends a GET request to the website, and retrieves the status code. Based on the status code (200 for success), it determines if the website is working or not working. The results are stored in a dictionary called status_dict. Finally, the function writes the website URLs along with their status (working or not working) to a CSV file named "website_status.csv".

**Note**: Ensure that the "websites.txt" file exists and contains valid website URLs. Make sure to have the necessary permissions to read from "websites.txt" and write to "website_status.csv". Additionally, the requests and csv modules need to be imported for the code to work correctly.
