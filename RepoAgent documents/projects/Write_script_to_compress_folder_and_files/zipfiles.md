## FunctionDef zip_file(file_path)
**zip_file**: The function of zip_file is to compress a file into a zip archive.

**parameters**:
- file_path: The path of the file to be compressed.

**Code Description**:
The zip_file function takes a file_path as input and creates a zip archive of the file. It uses the zipfile module to create a ZipFile object with the file_path appended with '.zip'. The file is then written to the zip archive using the write method of the ZipFile object with the compression type set to ZIP_DEFLATED. Finally, the ZipFile object is closed.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the file_path provided is valid and points to an existing file.
- Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during the compression process.
## FunctionDef retrieve_file_paths(dir_name)
**retrieve_file_paths**: The function of retrieve_file_paths is to retrieve all file paths within a specified directory.

**parameters**:
- dir_name: A string representing the directory path from which to retrieve file paths.

**Code Description**:
The retrieve_file_paths function initializes an empty list called file_paths to store the paths of all files found within the specified directory. It then uses the os.walk method to traverse through all directories, subdirectories, and files within the given dir_name. For each file found, the function constructs the full file path using os.path.join and appends it to the file_paths list. Finally, the function returns the list of all file paths.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the dir_name parameter is a valid directory path.

**Output Example**:
['/path/to/directory/file1.txt', '/path/to/directory/subdirectory/file2.txt', ...]
## FunctionDef zip_dir(dir_path, file_paths)
**zip_dir**: The function of zip_dir is to compress a directory along with its files into a zip archive.

**parameters**:
- dir_path: The path of the directory to be compressed.
- file_paths: A list of file paths within the directory to be included in the zip archive.

**Code Description**:
The zip_dir function takes a directory path and a list of file paths as input. It creates a new zip file with the name derived from the directory path and '.zip' extension. Then, it iterates through each file path in the provided list and writes them into the zip archive.

**Note**:
Ensure that the directory path and file paths are valid and accessible before calling the zip_dir function to avoid any errors during the compression process.
