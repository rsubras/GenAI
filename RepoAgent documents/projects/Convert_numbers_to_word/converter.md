## FunctionDef converter(n)
**converter**: The function of converter is to convert a given number into its word representation.

**parameters**:
- n: A string representing the number to be converted into words.

**Code Description**:
The `converter` function takes a number in string format as input and converts it into words. It first checks if the number is negative and appends "(negative)" to the word list if necessary. Then, it ensures that the number is in a format divisible by 3 by padding zeros if needed. The function then breaks down the number into groups of three digits and processes each group to convert it into words based on the digit values. It handles single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately, considering special cases like teens and tens. The function also inserts appropriate words like "and" and large number identifiers based on the position of the digit groups. Finally, it formats the word list into a sentence and returns the word representation of the number.

**Note**:
- The input number must be in string format.
- The function only supports converting numbers up to the trillion scale.

**Output Example**:
"Two hundred and thirty-four"
