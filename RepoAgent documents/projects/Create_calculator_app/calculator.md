## FunctionDef get_input(entry, argu)
**get_input**: The function of get_input is to insert the provided argument into the specified entry widget.

**parameters**:
- entry: Represents the entry widget where the input will be inserted.
- argu: The argument to be inserted into the entry widget.

**Code Description**:
The `get_input` function takes two parameters: `entry` and `argu`. It inserts the `argu` value into the `entry` widget. This function is called multiple times in the `cal` function within the same file to update the entry widget with the corresponding input based on the button pressed by the user.

In the `cal` function, various buttons are created for numbers, operators, and other functionalities. Each button is associated with a lambda function that calls `get_input` with the respective value to update the entry widget accordingly. This mechanism allows users to input numbers and operators into the calculator interface.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `entry` parameter passed to the `get_input` function is a valid entry widget where the input should be displayed.
## FunctionDef backspace(entry)
**backspace**: The function of backspace is to delete the last character in the entry field.

**parameters**:
- entry: Represents the entry field where the backspace operation will be performed.

**Code Description**:
The backspace function takes the entry field as a parameter, calculates the length of the input in the entry field, and then deletes the character at the position one less than the length of the input.

In the project, the backspace function is called when the user clicks the backspace button in the calculator app interface. This button is responsible for triggering the backspace function to delete the last character entered in the calculator's entry field.

**Note**:
Ensure that the entry field passed to the backspace function is the correct widget where the backspace operation should take place.
## FunctionDef clear(entry)
**clear**: The function of clear is to delete the content of the entry widget in a GUI application.

**parameters**:
- entry: Represents the entry widget where the content needs to be cleared.

**Code Description**:
The clear function takes an entry parameter, which is an Entry widget in a GUI application. It deletes the content of the entry widget by using the delete method with the range of 0 to END.

In the project, the clear function is called within the calc function. After performing a calculation and displaying the result in the entry widget, the clear function is invoked to clear the entry widget for the next input.

**Note**:
Ensure that the entry parameter passed to the clear function is an Entry widget in the GUI application.
## FunctionDef calc(entry)
**calc**: The function of calc is to evaluate the input expression provided in the entry widget, handle ZeroDivisionError exceptions, clear the entry widget, and display the result.

**parameters**:
- entry: Represents the entry widget where the input expression is entered.

**Code Description**:
The calc function retrieves the input expression from the entry widget, attempts to evaluate it using the eval function, and converts the result to a string. If a ZeroDivisionError occurs during evaluation, the function triggers the popupmsg function to alert the user. Subsequently, the function calls the clear function to clear the entry widget for the next input and inserts the output (if any) into the entry widget.

In the Create_calculator_app project, the calc function is utilized to process arithmetic operations entered by the user in the calculator GUI application. It interacts with the clear function to manage the content of the entry widget and with the popupmsg function to handle division by zero errors gracefully.

**Note**:
Ensure that the entry parameter passed to the calc function is an Entry widget in the GUI application. Handle exceptions like ZeroDivisionError to provide a better user experience and maintain the functionality of the calculator application.
## FunctionDef popupmsg
**popupmsg**: The function of popupmsg is to display an alert popup window with a message and an "Okay" button.

**parameters**: 
- This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The popupmsg Function creates a Tkinter popup window with a fixed size, title, and a message label that informs the user about a specific condition (in this case, division by zero). It also includes an "Okay" button that closes the popup window when clicked.

This Function is called within the calc Function in the calculator.py file of the Create_calculator_app project. When a ZeroDivisionError occurs during the evaluation of the input_info, the popupmsg Function is triggered to display an alert to the user. This alert informs the user that division by zero is not allowed and prompts them to enter valid values. After displaying the alert, the calc Function proceeds to clear the entry field and insert the output value (if any) into the entry field.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the popupmsg Function to create custom alert messages in their applications. It is essential to handle exceptions like ZeroDivisionError gracefully to provide a better user experience.
## FunctionDef cal
**cal**: The function of cal is to create a basic calculator GUI application with number buttons, operator buttons, and functionalities like backspace, clear, and calculation.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to the cal function. However, it interacts with various widgets and functions within the GUI application.

**Code Description**:
The cal function initializes a Tkinter root window for the calculator application. It sets up the entry widget for input display and creates buttons for numbers, operators, and other functionalities. Each button is associated with a lambda function that updates the entry widget based on user input. The function also handles button click events to perform specific actions like inserting numbers, operators, backspacing, clearing the entry, and calculating expressions. Additionally, it includes a Quit button to exit the application.

The cal function utilizes partial functions to create buttons with predefined styles and functionalities. It leverages the get_input function to update the entry widget with the corresponding input, the backspace function to delete the last character, the clear function to clear the entry widget, and the calc function to evaluate input expressions and display results. The GUI layout is organized using grid positioning to arrange the widgets effectively.

**Note**:
Ensure that the Tkinter library is installed to run the cal function successfully. Handle exceptions like ZeroDivisionError within the calc function to manage division by zero scenarios gracefully. Customize the button styles, layout, and functionality as needed to enhance the user experience of the calculator application.
### FunctionDef quit
**quit**: The function of quit is to set the command for exiting the root window.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The quit function assigns the command to exit the root window to the 'command' key of the exit dictionary.

**Note**: 
- This function does not take any parameters.
- Ensure that the 'root' object is defined and accessible before calling this function to avoid errors.
