## ClassDef obj
**obj**: The function of obj is to recursively convert a dictionary into a Python object.

**attributes**:
- parameter1: d (dictionary) - The input dictionary to be converted into a Python object.

**Code Description**:
The obj class defines a constructor (__init__) that takes a dictionary as input. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and sets attributes on the object instance based on the key-value pairs. If the value is another dictionary, it recursively creates a new obj instance for that value. This process continues until all nested dictionaries are converted into Python objects.

**Note**:
Ensure that the input dictionary does not contain circular references to prevent infinite recursion during the conversion process.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, d)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with the provided dictionary.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- d: A dictionary containing key-value pairs to initialize the object.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function iterates over the items in the input dictionary 'd'. For each key-value pair, it sets an attribute on the object with the key as the attribute name and the corresponding value. If the value is a dictionary, it creates a new object of the same type ('obj') recursively using the value as the argument.

**Note**:
- This function dynamically sets attributes on the object based on the keys and values in the input dictionary.
- If a value in the dictionary is itself a dictionary, a new object of the same type is created recursively.
