## FunctionDef on_message(msg)
**on_message**: The function of on_message is to respond with 'dong' when the incoming message is 'ding'.
**parameters**:
Â· msg: Represents the incoming message object.

**Code Description**: 
The `on_message` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `msg` parameter representing the incoming message. It checks if the text of the message is 'ding' using the `text()` method. If the message text is 'ding', it responds by sending 'dong' using the `say()` method on the message object.

This function is designed to handle incoming messages and provide a specific response based on the content of the message. It is typically used as a callback function in chatbot applications to process and respond to user messages.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the response message by modifying the conditional check inside the function. Additionally, this function should be registered as a callback for incoming messages in the chatbot application, as shown in the calling code snippet in the `main` function.
## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to initialize a Wechaty bot, register a message event listener, and start the bot to listen for incoming messages.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point for the chatbot application. Within this function, a Wechaty bot instance is created using the `Wechaty()` constructor. Subsequently, an event listener is registered using the `bot.on('message', on_message)` method, where the `on_message` function is called to handle incoming messages. Finally, the bot is started by awaiting the `bot.start()` method, allowing it to begin listening for and responding to messages.

The `main` function encapsulates the essential setup and initialization steps required to run the chatbot application effectively. By creating the bot instance, registering event handlers, and starting the bot, the function establishes the core functionality of the chatbot, enabling it to interact with users and respond to messages appropriately.

**Note**: 
Developers can extend the functionality of the chatbot by adding additional event listeners and customizing the bot's behavior within the `main` function. It is crucial to ensure that the necessary event handlers are registered to handle various types of incoming messages or events effectively. Additionally, any modifications or enhancements to the bot's functionality should be integrated within the `main` function to maintain a structured and organized codebase.
