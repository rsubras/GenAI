## ClassDef MyBot
**MyBot**: The function of MyBot is to listen to Wechaty events and handle various message types, interactions, and room operations.

**attributes**: 
- login_user: Optional[Contact] - stores the logged-in user contact information.

**Code Description**: 
The `MyBot` class extends the `Wechaty` class and provides methods to handle different events and messages within the Wechaty environment. The class includes methods like `on_ready`, `on_message`, `on_login`, `on_friendship`, and `on_room_join` to respond to various events such as user login, message reception, friendship requests, and room interactions. 

In the `on_message` method, the bot processes different types of messages including text, images, files, mini-programs, and room-related commands. It interacts with contacts, rooms, and messages based on the message content. For example, it responds to messages like 'ding' with 'dong', handles image files, processes file attachments, manages room members, sets aliases, and searches for friends.

The `on_login` method logs the user into the Wechaty environment and stores the login user's contact information. The `on_friendship` method deals with new friendship requests and accepts them based on predefined criteria. It also manages adding friends to rooms. 

The `on_room_join` method welcomes new contacts to a room and sends a greeting message to the new arrivals.

**Note**: 
- This class is designed to work within the Wechaty framework and requires proper initialization and event handling to function correctly.
- Ensure proper error handling and permissions when performing operations like adding or removing room members.
- Make sure to handle different message types appropriately to provide the expected responses.

**Output Example**:
A possible output could be sending a welcome message to new members joining a room in the Wechaty environment.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- msg: The message object containing information about the received message.

**Code Description**:
The `on_message` function first extracts information from the `msg` object such as the sender, message text, message type, and room details. It then processes the message based on its content. Here is a breakdown of the actions taken for different message scenarios:
- If the message text is 'ding', the bot responds with 'dong' and sends an image.
- If the message is an image, the bot saves the image in different resolutions and replies with the high-definition version.
- For file messages (audio, attachment, video), the bot saves the file locally.
- If the message is a mini-program, the bot responds with the mini-program details.
- If the message text is 'get room members', the bot retrieves and sends a list of room members.
- If the message text starts with 'remove room member:', the bot attempts to remove the specified room member.
- If the message text starts with 'get room topic', the bot retrieves and sends the room topic.
- If the message text starts with 'rename room topic:', the bot renames the room topic.
- If the message text starts with 'add new friend:', the bot searches for a contact and adds them as a friend.
- If the message text contains 'at me', the bot mentions the sender in the room.
- If the message text is 'my alias', the bot retrieves and sends the alias of the sender.
- If the message text starts with 'set alias:', the bot sets and retrieves a new alias for the sender.
- If the message text starts with 'find friends:', the bot searches for and retrieves friend information.

**Note**: The `on_message` function handles various message scenarios and performs actions accordingly, such as responding to specific texts, managing files, interacting with contacts, and modifying room settings.

**Output Example**: 
- If the message is an image, the bot saves the image in different resolutions and replies with the high-definition version.

### FunctionDef on_login(self, contact)
**on_login**: The function of on_login is to handle the login event when a contact logs in.

**parameters**:
- contact (Contact): the account that has logged in.

**Code Description**:
This async function, on_login, takes a Contact object as a parameter, representing the account that has just logged in. Upon execution, it logs a message using the logger.info method, indicating that a specific contact has successfully logged in. Additionally, it assigns the logged-in contact to the login_user attribute of the class.

**Note**:
Ensure that the Contact object passed as a parameter is valid and contains the necessary information for the login event handling.
***
### FunctionDef on_friendship(self, friendship)
**on_friendship**: The function of on_friendship is to handle new friendship applications and accept new friendships.

**parameters**:
- friendship (Friendship): contains the status and friendship information such as hello text and friend contact object.

**Code Description**:
The `on_friendship` function is an asynchronous method that takes a `Friendship` object as a parameter. It first checks the type of the friendship - whether it is a new friendship application or a confirmed friendship. If the type is a new friendship application, it extracts the hello text from the friendship and accepts the friendship if the text contains the keyword 'wechaty'. On the other hand, if the type is a confirmed friendship, it searches for rooms containing the keyword 'Wechaty' and adds the new friend to a suitable room if the room's member count is below the maximum limit defined by `MAX_ROOM_MEMBER_COUNT`.

**Note**:
- Make sure to handle new friendship applications and confirmed friendships appropriately based on the conditions specified in the code.
- Ensure that the keyword 'wechaty' is used to accept new friendship applications.
- Check and add new friends to suitable rooms based on the room's member count and the keyword 'Wechaty'.
