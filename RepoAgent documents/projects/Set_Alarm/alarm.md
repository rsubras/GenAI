## FunctionDef rename_files_with_whitespaces(cd, files, extra_path)
**rename_files_with_whitespaces**: The function of rename_files_with_whitespaces is to replace whitespaces in file names with underscores.

**parameters**:
- cd: The current directory path.
- files: A list of file names to check and rename.
- extra_path: An optional parameter for specifying an additional path within the current directory.

**Code Description**:
The `rename_files_with_whitespaces` function iterates through the list of file names provided. If a file name contains a whitespace, it replaces the whitespace with an underscore and renames the file accordingly using the `os.rename` function.

This function is called within the `set_alarm` function in the `set_alarm` module. In the `set_alarm` function, after setting the alarm time and checking the music files in the "musics" folder, `rename_files_with_whitespaces` is used to ensure that any file names containing whitespaces are modified before further processing.

**Note**:
It is essential to ensure that the paths and file names are correctly provided to avoid any errors in renaming files.
## FunctionDef clean_filename(file)
**clean_filename**: The function of clean_filename is to capitalize the first letter of each word in a filename by removing the file extension and splitting the filename by underscores.

**parameters**:
- file: A string representing the filename.

**Code Description**:
The clean_filename function takes a filename as input, removes the file extension, splits the filename by underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then joins the words with spaces. This function ensures that the filename is properly formatted for display purposes.

In the project, the clean_filename function is used to format the names of music files before displaying them to the user when setting an alarm. It helps in presenting the music filenames in a more readable and user-friendly manner.

**Note**:
- Make sure to pass a valid filename string to the clean_filename function.
- The function assumes that the filename has underscores as separators and ends with a file extension.

**Output Example**:
If the input filename is "morning_alarm.mp3", the clean_filename function will return "Morning Alarm".
## FunctionDef set_alarm
**set_alarm**: The function of set_alarm is to allow the user to set an alarm time, select an alarm music from a list, and trigger the alarm at the specified time by playing the selected music.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to the set_alarm function.

**Code Description**:
The set_alarm function initiates by prompting the user to set the alarm time in a specific format (e.g., 01:10). It validates the input time format and proceeds to set up the alarm music by renaming any music files in the "musics" folder that contain whitespaces. After ensuring the availability of at least one music file, the user is prompted to select an alarm music from the list. Once the alarm time and music are set, the function continuously checks the current time and triggers the alarm by playing the selected music when the alarm time is reached.

The set_alarm function interacts with other functions within the same module, such as rename_files_with_whitespaces and clean_filename, to handle file renaming and formatting of music filenames for user-friendly display during the alarm setup process.

**Note**:
- Ensure to input the alarm time in the correct format (HH:MM) to avoid errors.
- Make sure to have music files in the "musics" folder before setting the alarm.
- Select an alarm music by entering the index corresponding to the desired music from the displayed list.
- The function will continuously run until the alarm time is reached, playing the selected music as the alarm notification.
## FunctionDef display_header(header)
**display_header**: The function of display_header is to print a formatted header with the provided text in the center of the terminal window.

**parameters**:
- header: A string representing the text to be displayed in the header.

**Code Description**:
The display_header function takes a header string as input and prints a header with the provided text centered in the terminal window. It consists of three lines: the top and bottom lines contain a row of '#' characters, and the middle line contains the header text enclosed by '######'. The centering of the header text is achieved by using the os.get_terminal_size().columns function to determine the width of the terminal window and center the header accordingly.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a meaningful header text to be displayed.
- The appearance of the header may vary based on the size of the terminal window.
