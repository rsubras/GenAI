## FunctionDef connect_to_mailbox
**connect_to_mailbox**: The function of connect_to_mailbox is to establish a connection to a mailbox using IMAP protocol, log in with provided credentials, select the INBOX mailbox, and return the mail connection and messages.

**parameters**:
- host: The hostname of the mail server.
- port: The port number for the mail server.
- ssl_context: The SSL context for establishing a secure connection.
- credential_path: The path to the file containing the user's credentials.

**Code Description**:
The `connect_to_mailbox` function utilizes the imaplib library to connect to a mailbox securely using IMAP4_SSL. It reads the user's credentials from a specified file, logs in to the mailbox, selects the INBOX mailbox, and returns the mail connection and messages. This function is crucial for establishing a connection to the mailbox before further operations such as fetching emails.

In the calling object `main`, after calling `connect_to_mailbox`, the function retrieves the total number of emails in the INBOX, sets the number of latest emails to fetch, and then writes the email details to a CSV file. Exception handling is implemented to catch any errors that may occur during the process.

**Note**:
- Ensure the `credential_path` points to a valid file containing the user's credentials in the format: username on the first line and password on the second line.
- Proper error handling should be implemented for cases where the connection or login to the mailbox fails.

**Output Example**:
```
(mail_connection_object, messages)
```
## FunctionDef get_text(email_body)
**get_text**: The function of get_text is to extract text content from the provided email body using BeautifulSoup and return it with specified separator and stripping.

**parameters**:
- email_body: The email body from which text content needs to be extracted.

**Code Description**:
The get_text function takes the email_body as input, then creates a BeautifulSoup object with the email_body and "lxml" parser. It extracts the text content using the get_text method of the BeautifulSoup object with the specified separator as "\n" and stripping enabled. Finally, it returns the extracted text content.

In the calling object write_to_csv, the get_text function is utilized to extract text content from email bodies. It is called within a loop to process email messages, extract text content, and write the extracted data into a CSV file along with other email details like date, sender, and subject.

**Note**: 
- The get_text function relies on the BeautifulSoup library, so make sure it is installed in the environment where the code is executed.
- Ensure that the email_body provided to get_text is in a format that can be decoded to UTF-8.

**Output Example**:
Extracted text content from the email body.
## FunctionDef write_to_csv(mail, writer, N, total_no_of_mails)
**write_to_csv**: The function of write_to_csv is to fetch a specified number of latest emails, extract relevant information such as date, sender, subject, and text content, and write this information into a CSV file.

**parameters**:
- mail: The mailbox object used to fetch email messages.
- writer: The CSV writer object to write data into the CSV file.
- N: The number of latest emails to fetch.
- total_no_of_mails: The total number of emails in the mailbox.

**Code Description**:
The write_to_csv function iterates over the specified number of latest emails in reverse order. It fetches each email message, extracts relevant information such as date, sender, subject, and text content. The text content is extracted using the get_text function. If the email is multipart, it iterates over the email parts to extract the text content. Finally, it writes the extracted information into a CSV file row by row.

The get_text function is utilized within write_to_csv to extract text content from email bodies. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the email body and extract text content with a specified separator and stripping. The extracted text content is then written into the CSV file along with other email details.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the BeautifulSoup library is installed in the environment to use the get_text function.
- The email_body provided to get_text should be in a format that can be decoded to UTF-8 for proper text extraction.
- Exception handling is implemented to log any errors that may occur during the execution of the write_to_csv function.

This function is called within the main function of the store_emails.py script to fetch and process email messages, demonstrating its role in the email processing workflow of the Store_emails_in_csv project.
## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to establish a connection to a mailbox, fetch a specified number of latest emails, and write the email details into a CSV file with error handling for exceptions.
**parameters**:
- No explicit parameters are passed to the main function. However, it internally calls other functions with their respective parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `main` function initiates by calling the `connect_to_mailbox` function to establish a connection to the mailbox and retrieve the total number of emails. It then sets the number of latest emails to fetch and proceeds to write the email details (date, sender, subject, text content) into a CSV file. The function incorporates exception handling to catch and log any errors that may occur during the process.

The `main` function serves as the entry point for processing emails in the Store_emails_in_csv project. It orchestrates the connection to the mailbox, fetching of emails, and writing of email details into a CSV file, demonstrating a key role in the email processing workflow.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `csv_path` variable is defined with the correct path to the CSV file where email details will be written.
- Proper configuration of the logging module is essential to handle and log exceptions effectively during the execution of the `main` function.
- The `N` variable determines the number of latest emails to fetch, adjust it as needed based on the requirements.
- Implement additional error handling as per project-specific requirements to enhance the robustness of the email processing functionality.
