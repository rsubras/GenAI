## FunctionDef get_files(path)
**get_files**: The function of get_files is to return a list of files available in the given folder.
**parameters**:
- path: A string representing the path of the folder to retrieve files from.

**Code Description**:
The get_files function utilizes the glob module to fetch a list of files within the specified folder path. It then returns this list of files.

This function is called within the start_process function in the split_and_copy.py file. In the start_process function, the get_files function is used to retrieve a list of files from a specified path before further processing the files.

**Note**:
Ensure that the path provided is valid and points to an existing folder.
Consider handling exceptions if the path is incorrect or inaccessible.

**Output Example**:
['file1.txt', 'file2.jpg', 'file3.pdf']
## FunctionDef getfullpath(path)
**getfullpath**: The function of getfullpath is to return the absolute path of a given file.
**parameters**: 
- path: The path of the file for which the absolute path needs to be retrieved.
**Code Description**: 
The getfullpath function takes a file path as input and returns the absolute path of the file using the os.path.abspath() method. This function is essential for obtaining the full path of a file, which can be useful for various file operations.
In the project, this function is called within the start_process function in the split_and_copy.py file. It is used to retrieve the absolute path of files before copying them to a specific location. By using getfullpath, the code ensures that the files are copied from their original locations to the designated folders accurately.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input path provided to the getfullpath function is a valid file path.
**Output Example**: 
If the input path is 'example.txt', the getfullpath function may return '/path/to/example.txt'.
## FunctionDef copyfiles(src, dst)
**copyfiles**: The function of copyfiles is to copy a file from the source directory to the destination directory. 
**parameters**: 
- src: The source file path to be copied.
- dst: The destination directory where the file will be copied.

**Code Description**: 
The `copyfiles` function first checks if the destination directory exists. If it does not exist, a new directory is created using `os.makedirs(dst)`. Then, the function copies the file from the source to the destination using `copy2(src, dst)`.

This function is called by the `start_process` function in the `split_and_copy.py` file. In the `start_process` function, files are retrieved from a specified path, split into multiple folders, and then for each file in each folder, the `copyfiles` function is called to copy the file to a new location with a specific name.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the source file path (`src`) and the destination directory path (`dst`) are correctly provided to avoid any errors during the file copying process.
## FunctionDef split(data, count)
**split**: The function of split is to split a given list of files into sublists based on the specified count and return a generator.

**parameters**:
- data: A list of files to be split.
- count: An integer specifying the number of files in each sublist.

**Code Description**:
The split function takes a list of files and a count as input parameters. It then iterates over the list of files and yields sublists containing the specified number of files. If the last sublist does not have enough files to meet the count, it will contain the remaining files.

This function is called by the start_process function in the split_and_copy.py file. In the start_process function, the split function is used to split a list of files into sublists based on the count provided. Each sublist is then processed by copying the files to a new folder.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the count parameter is a positive integer to avoid errors.
- The split function returns a generator, so it needs to be iterated over to access the sublists.

**Output Example**:
If the input list of files is ['file1', 'file2', 'file3', 'file4', 'file5'] and the count is 2, the split function will yield the following sublists:
- ['file1', 'file2']
- ['file3', 'file4']
- ['file5']
## FunctionDef start_process(path, count)
**start_process**: The function of start_process is to retrieve files from a specified folder, split them into sublists based on the provided count, and then copy these files to new folders with specific names.

**parameters**:
- path: A string representing the path of the folder containing the files.
- count: An integer specifying the number of files to be included in each sublist.

**Code Description**:
The start_process function first calls the get_files function to obtain a list of files from the given path. It then utilizes the split function to divide the list of files into sublists based on the count provided. Subsequently, for each sublist, the function generates a unique folder name and copies the files from the original path to the new folder using the copyfiles function.

This function establishes a workflow where files are organized into subfolders for better management and processing. By leveraging the functionalities of get_files, split, and copyfiles, start_process streamlines the process of splitting and copying files efficiently.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the path parameter leads to a valid folder path with the intended files.
- Provide a positive integer for the count parameter to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Verify the availability of the necessary modules and functions (get_files, split, copyfiles) before executing start_process to prevent runtime errors.
