## FunctionDef pp_download(username)
**pp_download**: The function of pp_download is to download the profile picture of a given Instagram username.

**parameters**:
- username: A string representing the Instagram username for which the profile picture needs to be downloaded.

**Code Description**:
The pp_download function takes an Instagram username as input and constructs the URL to the user's profile. It then checks the validity of the URL and processes it to download the profile picture. The function uses regular expressions to match different URL patterns and determine the final URL for fetching the profile picture. If the URL is valid, it sends a request to the Instagram server to retrieve the profile picture image. The function then saves the image locally and displays it using the Image module. In case of any errors during the process, it catches exceptions and prints an error message.

The function ensures that the URL is valid and meets specific criteria before proceeding with the download process. It utilizes the requests library to handle HTTP requests, re module for regular expressions, and tqdm for displaying a progress bar during the download.

**Note**:
- Ensure the provided username is a valid Instagram username.
- The function relies on external libraries such as requests, re, tqdm, and Image, so make sure these are installed in your environment.
- Handle exceptions appropriately to manage errors during the download process.
