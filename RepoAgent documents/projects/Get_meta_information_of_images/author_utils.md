## ClassDef SID_NAME_USE
**SID_NAME_USE**: The function of SID_NAME_USE is to represent the type of a Security Identifier (SID) in Windows.

**attributes**:
- value: Represents the value of the SID.
- _sid_types: A dictionary mapping SID values to their corresponding types.

**Code Description**:
The SID_NAME_USE class inherits from wintypes.DWORD and provides functionality to handle different types of SIDs in Windows. It contains an internal dictionary `_sid_types` that maps integer values to specific SID types such as User, Group, Domain, etc. The class constructor `__init__` initializes the SID object with a specific value if provided, and raises a ValueError if the value is not a valid SID type. The `__str__` method returns the string representation of the SID type based on its integer value. The `__repr__` method returns a string representation of the SID_NAME_USE object.

In the calling function `look_up_account_sid` in the author_utils.py file, an instance of SID_NAME_USE is created to store the type of a SID retrieved using the `LookupAccountSidW` function from the advapi32 library. The function returns the name, domain, and type of the SID.

**Note**:
