## FunctionDef stretch(text, maxlength)
**stretch**: The function of stretch is to recursively append random characters to a text string until it reaches the specified maximum length.

**parameters**:
- text: The current text string to which random characters are appended.
- maxlength: The maximum length that the text string should reach.

**Code Description**:
The stretch function checks if the length of the text string is less than the specified maximum length. If it is, the function calls the get_random_char function to generate a random character and appends it to the text string. This process continues recursively until the text string's length equals or exceeds the maximum length. Once the condition is met, the function returns the final text string.

The get_random_char function is crucial for providing random characters that are added to the text string during each recursive call of the stretch function. By utilizing get_random_char, stretch ensures the randomness and variability of characters in the generated text string.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the get_random_char function is defined and accessible before calling the stretch function.
- The stretch function is designed for generating text strings of a specific length by adding random characters iteratively.
- This function can be used in password generation, text obfuscation, or any scenario requiring the creation of random text strings.

**Output Example**:
If the maximum length is set to 10 and the initial text string is "abc", the function may return "abcde1f2g" after appending random characters through recursion.
## FunctionDef get_random_char
**get_random_char**: The function of get_random_char is to generate a random character from the string.printable set.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The get_random_char function first defines a set of printable characters using the string.printable attribute. It then selects a random index within the range of the characters set using the random.randint function. Finally, it returns the character at the randomly selected index.

In the context of the project, this function is utilized to generate a random character that is then appended to a text string in the stretch function. This process is repeated recursively until the length of the text string reaches the specified maximum length.

**Note**: 
- This function relies on the string and random modules, so ensure they are imported before calling get_random_char.
- The function returns a single random character from the set of printable characters.

**Output Example**: 
'A'
